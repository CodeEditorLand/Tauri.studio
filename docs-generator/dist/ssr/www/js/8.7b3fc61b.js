The world of Open Source is fraught with peril and discord, and we have taken measures to ensure the longevity of Tauri. This document explains how we go about doing so.\n\n### Organizational Structure\nTauri apps is governed by the community and work is done in the context of public working groups. Each working group has a dedicated channel on the Discord server as well as a Team on GitHub. Other than that, each WG is free to use whatever type of organizational model it chooses.\n\n The current working groups are:\n- WG Governance & Guidance\n- WG Tech\n- WG Education\n- WG Media\n- WG Security\n- WG Devops\n\nWith the exception of the security working group, which is by invite only and convenes privately, all other working groups are public and open to any and all participants.\n\nPlease visit [this repository](https://github.com/tauri-apps/governance-and-guidance) to get more information.\n\n### Code of Conduct\nEveryone participating in the Tauri commnunity is expected to follow a code of conduct that you can at the [Governance and Guidance:Code of Conduct](https://github.com/tauri-apps/governance-and-guidance/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n### Social Contract\nWe have a Social Contract that informs our decision making and organization. You can read about it here: [Governance and Guidance:Social Contract](https://github.com/tauri-apps/governance-and-guidance/blob/master/SOCIAL_CONTRACT.md).\n\n### Licensing\nWe, the contributors to Tauri Apps, use the MIT and Apache licenses for all code content.
