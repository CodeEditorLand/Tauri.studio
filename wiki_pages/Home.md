# Tauri Documentation

This wiki documentation is a WIP, and will be transferred to a dedicated
documentation site **in the very near future**.™️ Our decision to use the wiki
format was made in order to enable the working groups to rapidly iterate on the
contents.

If you find an error and would like to propose an improvement, you have several
options:

1. Open an issue.
2. Visit our [`discord server`](HTTPS://discord.gg/SpmNs4S) and raise your
   concern.
3. Request to join one of the working groups to gain access (on Discord).

## Audience

It is primarily written from the perspective of enabling contributors to
understand how Tauri works under the hood. Nevertheless, it should also be
instructive for anyone interested in implementing Tauri in their own projects.
