## Introduction to immutable checksum
It is not only possible, but trivial to modify release notes and artifacts after it has been published on github. While there are very valid reasons for doing this, it is not exactly a totally trustworthy method - i.e. you have no guarantee that what you are reading is really reflective of the underlying truth or the tarballs. It is technically possible to change downloads over the wire or in the box or change checksums in targetted attacks. What we are seeking to accomplish is a best case scenario where:

1. Human error is reduced to a minimum, but humans are still integral in the actual release
2. Machine built assets, changelogs and attached security audits are verifiable with checksums that are published in an immutable, globally available store.

To this end we are fashioning a workflow that works in the following way:

1. a human pushes to dev (using PR labels for better changesets)
    - increase the version number everywhere
    - creates a changeset file for that version
2. a codeowner pushes to master (from dev, no direct push permissible for anyone)
    - testing !!! non-zero breaks the push !!!
        - runs sanity tests
        - runs all unit tests
        - triggers all smoke tests
3. a codeowner creates a tag at master ie. 1.3.1
    - sanity check
    - vulnerability audit (crates and yarn)
    - builders
        - build and publish to crates.io
        - publish to npm
        - create tarballs / artifacts
    - checksum tarballs / artifacts
    - async process to publish the checksums and metadata to IOTA tangle (feeless)
        - attach the iota link to the draft release
        - attach the release notes to the draft release
        - attach security audits to the draft release
    - attach tarballs / artifacts to a draft release
4. a codeowner reviews the draft release, edits and publishes


------------

After we have successfully rolled this out, in future work we will transfer the built assets to additional places:
1. Tauri's private verdaccio
2. IPFS
3. PureOS Gitlab
4. GitHub Packages
