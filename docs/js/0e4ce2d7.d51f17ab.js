But seriously, if you want to help out explaining how newbies to Arch can do this, please feel free to make a PR to this doc.\n\n### BSD\nSimilar to Arch, you already have everything installed because you compile kernels. However:\n- Execution on OpenBSD requires wxallowed mount(8) option.\n- FreeBSD is also supported, to install webkit2 run pkg install webkit2-gtk3.\n\n### Ubuntu\nFirst install Ubuntu then:\n\n    $ sudo apt update && sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev build-essential\n\n### MacOS\n    $ brew install gcc\n\n### Everybody except Windows\n\n    $ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh\n\n> We have audited this bash script, and it does what it says it is supposed to do. Nevertheless, before blindly curl-bashing a script, it is always wise to look at it first. Here is file as a mere [download link](https://sh.rustup.rs)\n\nMake sure that `rustc` and `cargo` are in your $PATH. Run\n\n    $ rustc --version\n    latest update on 2019-07-04, rust version 1.37.0\n\nand make sure you are on latest update on 2019-07-04, rust version 1.37.0 - otherwise be sure to update.\n\n    $ rustup update stable\n    $ rustup override set 1.37.0\n\n\n## About `rustup` (from their [website](https://rustup.rs))\n`rustup` installs rustc, cargo, rustup and other standard tools to Cargo's bin directory. On Unix it is located at `$HOME/.cargo/bin` and on Windows at `%USERPROFILE%\\.cargo\\bin`. This is the same directory that cargo install will install Rust programs and Cargo plugins.\n\nThis directory will be in your `$PATH` environment variable, which means you can run them from the shell without further configuration. **Open a new shell** and type the following:\n\n    $ rustc --version\n\nor run:\n\n    source $HOME/.cargo/env\n    \n    # and then\n    \n    $ rustc --version\n\nIf you don't see 1.37.0 or later, then you'll need to upgrade your rust.\n \n    $ rustup update stable\n    $ rustup override set 1.37.0\n\n### bundler\nAfter you have installed Rust and the build toolchain, it is wise to open a new shell before continuing.\n\nSetup the bundler:\n\n    $ cargo install --path node_modules/@tauri-apps/tauri/tools/rust/cargo-tauri-bundle --force\n\nWant to debug?\n#### *nix\n\n    $ cd src-tauri\n    $ RUST_DEBUG=1 cargo build\n\n#### Windows\n\n    $ cd src-tauri\n    $ set RUST_DEBUG=1\n    $ cargo build\n\n\n\n## experimental anti-bloat features\n\nsee: https://github.com/RazrFalcon/cargo-bloat\nhttps://lifthrasiir.github.io/rustlog/why-is-a-rust-executable-large.html\nhttps://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-profile-sections\n\n### Bundler\nadd this to your `/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` (currently being used in the /test project)\n\n    [profile.release]\n    panic = \"abort\"\n    codegen-units = 1\n    lto = true\n    incremental = false\n    opt-level = \"z\"\n\n\n### upx\nUPX, **Ultimate Packer for eXecutables**, is a dinosaur amongst the binary packers. This 23-year old, well-maintained piece of kit is GPL-v2 licensed with a pretty liberal usage declaration. Our understanding of the licensing is that you can use it for any purposes (commercial or otherwise) without needing to change your license unless you modify the source code of UPX.\n\n Basically it compresses the binary and decompresses it at runtime. It should work for pretty much any binary type out there.
